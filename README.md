> [!NOTE]
> WezTerm includes Nerd Fonts by default. If you want to use VS Code's integrated terminal, follow the steps below to ensure compatibility.

## VS Code Configuration

To ensure the theme is fully compatible with the VS Code integrated terminal, install and set a font from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

1.  After installing the font, update your VS Code `settings.json` with your installed font as follows:

```json
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font",
    "editor.fontLigatures": true
}
```
